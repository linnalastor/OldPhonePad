An old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button. 
Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter.

For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice in succession will return‘B’.
